# Getting started

## Introduction

OCA is a pattern (architecture) that defines a new representation of data
semantics. Official OCA documentation is under development hosted by [Human
Colossus Foundation](https://humancolossus.foundation). For years concept of OCA
was incubated within communities like [Inputs and Semantics Working
Group](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Inputs+and+Semantics+Working+Group)
at [Trust over
IP](https://trustoverip.org/working-groups/decentralized-semantics/). And
Hyperledger Aries
[RFC-0014](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0013-overlays).

Developers can follow current specification work in the [official
repository](https://the-human-colossus-foundation.github.io/oca-spec/).

Due to a rapidly-evolving OCA core specification, future implementations may
differ somewhat. The most up to date implementation is Rust, which would provide
bindings to other languages.

- [Rust](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-rust) with compile targets to other
  languages like JavaScript, Python and more planed.
- Deprecated: ~~[Kotlin](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-kotlin) with compile target to JavaScript~~
- Deprecated: ~~[Ruby](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-ruby)~~

Those core libraries allow the creation, parsing and management of OCA objects.
