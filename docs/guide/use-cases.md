## IoT

The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such
objects) that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other
technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over
the Internet or other communications networks.

OCA helps not only to harmonize the data among a vast amount of HW providers and
manufactures it allows you to create automated data pipelines where the data can
flow in an authentic way without losing its context.

OCA provides mechanism to preserve the context of the data captured at the edge with
accurate semantic where the data are coming from, e.g. temperature sensor
located on the top of the device, measuring temperature inside the device.

Just losing the information about where the sensor is located could harm the
value of the information collected down the pipeline and in any case unable to
reason based on the information which was provided.

## Verifiable Credential and Presentation

Verifiable credentials represent statements made by an issuer in a
tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.

OCA allows creating verifiable credentials which would be flexible enough
to support multiple languages or layouts without the need to re-issue new
credentials. OCA bundle provides a way to create schema which can have multiple
issuers and still be end-verifiable. This allows designing presentation layers
according to the needs of specific jurisdictions without the need to recreate the capture
base from scratch.  This would increase the reusability of the schema and data
portability.

Imagine a driving license credential that can be issued in Poland, and presented
in China with local language without the need for the user to have any Chinese
translation since this layer is issued and applied by the Chines authority
directly during the presentation process. Since everything relay on content
addressable identifiers, all layers would be end-verifiable and can be correctly
validated by local police authority in China.


## Harmonize your data

The challenge for harmonization of the data is to be able to support a vast amount
of ontologies (naming conventions) and capture the context of collected
the information which can flow down the pipeline.

OCA allows you easily to not only trace the data objects but as well reuse those
object and compose semantics in a way that you can create huge data sets
preserving the meaning.

With captured context via OCA objects, you can then measure similarities and
the proximity of the attributes while you merge the data. This not only allows you
to leverage graph structures for analytics and machine learning but as well
scoring your data sets for quality and accuracy so you can use them for decision
making process with higher assurance.

## Supply chain

Due to the complexity and vast amount of actors within the data-driven supply chains
ecosystem, one of the biggest problems is lack of portability, traceability, and poor
data. Due to that the decision cannot be fully automated and manual processes slow
time to market and is error-prone.

OCA through its layer architecture allows addressing problems of
multi-stakeholder governances, introducing content-based tracing mechanism,
increasing the data quality due to preserving meaning and enabling sharing which
allows to data flow without risk to lose its characteristics.
