# OCA Tools

HCF has facilitated the development of a set of tools to make OCA integration easier for developers.

## OCA Browser

OCA Browser is an easy-to-use application to enable users to generate
OCA Bundle from XLS file and preview OCA Form and OCA Credential of selected
OCA Bundle.

## OCA Editor [Deprecated]

OCA Editor is an easy-to-use middleware solution to enable users to create,
modify and manage OCA objects. The core development team created the tool with
non-technical people in mind. Through a 'drag and drop' approach, anyone can
create and publish OCA schemas. We highly recommend building OCA schemas via
this editor as the first port-of-call.
