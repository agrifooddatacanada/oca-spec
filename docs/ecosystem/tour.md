# OCA Ecosystem Tour

There are many related concepts to OCA that on their own require additional explanation. Thus, the OCA Ecosystem is a conceptual definition of all the basic concepts that play important role in the ecosystem. Around the concepts, components are defined that come with implementation.

The OCA Ecosystem consists of the following components:
- [OCA Parser](/ecosystem/oca-parser) – allows to define OCA Bundles in a common format (currently from XLS);
- [OCA Browser](/ecosystem/oca-browser) – renders OCA Bundle preview in a WEB browser;
- [OCA Repository](/ecosystem/oca-repository) – manages OCA Bundles;
- [OCA Data Vault](/ecosystem/oca-data-vault) – stores OCA Bundle related assets and code tables;
- [OCA Transformer](/ecosystem/oca-transformer) – allows to apply transformations upon OCA Bundle;

OCA can be tested and developed on Argo, a dedicated sandbox environment hosted
by Human Colossus Foundation.
